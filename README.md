# DSC 261: Responsible Data Science 



## Description:

This course delves into Responsible Data Science, emphasizing the importance of conscientious practices in data analysis and application. It commences with Causal Inference, enabling students to distinguish between correlation and causation for accurate data interpretation. Subsequent modules cover Algorithmic Fairness to promote unbiased AI development, and Explainable AI, which aims to enhance the transparency and reliability of AI outputs. The curriculum concludes with Data Cleaning, Profiling, and Debiasing, where students learn to refine data quality and mitigate inherent biases. The course is tailored for those seeking to apply data science principles responsibly in practical scenarios.

## Course Workload

The course evaluation is project-based, emphasizing teamwork, practical application of data science techniques, and effective communication. Students will collaborate in teams to conceptualize and develop projects that reflect real-world problems and data scenarios. This includes drafting thorough project proposals, executing data science methodologies, and presenting their findings and models. Insightful peer reviews will be integral, providing a platform for constructive critique and learning. The hands-on experience is further enriched by the creation of engaging visual posters and dynamic in-class presentations, all designed to foster a deep understanding of responsible data science in action. For an in-depth guide to the project ideas and a comprehensive timeline, please refer to the designated [Google Docs]().
