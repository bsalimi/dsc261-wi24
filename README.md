# DSC 261: Responsible Data Science 



## Description:

This course delves into Responsible Data Science, emphasizing the importance of conscientious practices in data analysis and application. It commences with Causal Inference, enabling students to distinguish between correlation and causation for accurate data interpretation. Subsequent modules cover Algorithmic Fairness to promote unbiased AI development, and Explainable AI, which aims to enhance the transparency and reliability of AI outputs. The curriculum concludes with Data Cleaning, Profiling, and Debiasing, where students learn to refine data quality and mitigate inherent biases. The course is tailored for those seeking to apply data science principles responsibly in practical scenarios.

## Course Workload

In this course, students will engage in a project-based learning experience, emphasizing teamwork, practical application of data science techniques, and effective communication. Groups of 2-3 students will collaborate to develop projects on topics relevant to the class. These projects can range from open-ended research that could potentially lead to a paper to the implementation and analysis of algorithms, building tools with GUIs for applications in responsible data science, or analyzing real and synthetic datasets. The focus is on applying responsible data science methodologies to real-world problems and data scenarios, rather than just reading papers or writing surveys.


The course will have three checkpoints: an initial proposal, a midterm update, and a final report. Students are encouraged to meet with the instructor regularly for guidance. The project will culminate in a short in-class presentation. Evaluation will consider the team's effort, the results, the quality of the related work survey, and the effectiveness of their presentation and final report. Students will also participate in peer reviews, offering and receiving constructive feedback. To enhance the learning experience, students will create visual posters and dynamic presentations, aiming to foster a deep understanding of responsible data science.
